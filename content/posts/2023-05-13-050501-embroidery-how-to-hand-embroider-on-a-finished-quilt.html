<p><b>How to Hand Embroider on a Finished Quilt</b></p>
<p>Hand embroidery is a great way to add a unique touch to a finished quilt. It can be used to add a special message, a decorative pattern, or even a portrait. With a few simple supplies and a bit of practice, you can create beautiful embroidery designs on your quilt.</p>
<p>To get started, you will need a few supplies. You will need an embroidery hoop, embroidery floss, a needle, and a pair of scissors. You will also need a quilt that is already finished. Once you have all of your supplies, you can begin to embroider. Start by threading your needle with the embroidery floss. Then, place your quilt in the embroidery hoop and begin to stitch. You can use a variety of stitches to create different patterns and designs. When you are finished, cut off the excess floss and tie a knot to secure the thread.</p>
<p>Hand embroidery is a great way to add a personal touch to your quilt. With a bit of practice, you can create beautiful designs that will last for years to come. So, grab your supplies and get stitching!</p>
